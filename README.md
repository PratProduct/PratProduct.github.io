## Problem Statement

## Need
Who is the solution for? -The solution caters to the layman investors who do not have access to financial advisors but want to increase their earning potential by making smart investment decisions. 
### Stakeholders 
- Layman investors
-	Regulatory bodies like SEBI which will guide the policy changes
-	Organizations which publish the financial documents
-	Financial analysts who can validate the usefulness of the results of the offering

### Market Size 
The current number of active DEMAT accounts stands at 11.45 crores and has witnessed an increase of 43% since last year.
### What are the user’s needs? 
-	The solution should guide the users in the direction of making smart investment by nudging them towards considering key parameters for investment.
-	The solution should bridge the gap between a layman and an expert by making less use of jargonish language.
-	The solution should be easily accessible.
Why is there a need for this solution? – 
-	Because of the lack of financial literacy in the country, a layman investor finds it hard to understand jargons in the financial reports which are prepared by the domain experts.
-	Since these documents cater to a wide range of stakeholders, the financial documents are usually extensive and thus, a layman investor finds it hard to understand which sections of the document are relevant for making investment decisions.
